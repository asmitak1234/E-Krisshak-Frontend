## Description

Hello Everyone, I am ASMITA KUMARI , a young learner and i am here with frontend part of my project called "E-Krisshak" , A farmer availability management system that helps to select and find a farmer for your field with their proper and detailed Personal, Professional and Contact information that helps you to store and choose them according to your requirements.This is a Secure and Efficient WebApp and I am making this project with the intension of helping the land-owners that can't find farmer for their field and many farmers that are seeking for work ,especially in INDIA.

This project is a React-based full-stack CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) Web Application that interfaces with a Django backend and uses a MySQL Database for persistent data storage with. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs. This README outlines how to set up the project, its main functionalities, and steps for deployment of frontend of this project.

## Requirements

- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm (or yarn) for managing JavaScript packages
- Python 3.8 or higher for the Django backend
- MySQL server for the database

## Setup

### Backend Setup

Before setting up the React frontend, ensure the Django backend is properly configured. This project assumes you have an existing Django backend with a MySQL database.

1. *Clone the Backend Repository*

   Clone the Django project repository if you havenâ€™t already:

   bash:
   git clone https://github.com/asmitak1234/E-Krisshak-backend.git
   cd ekrisshakbackend
   

2. *Create and Activate a Virtual Environment*

   bash:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   

3. *Install Backend Dependencies*

   bash:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. *Configure MySQL Database*

   - Ensure MySQL is running.
   - Update the settings.py in the Django project to connect to your MySQL database.

5. *Apply Migrations and Run the Server*

   bash:
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   

   The Django backend should be running on http://localhost:8000.

### Frontend Setup

1. *Clone the Frontend Repository*

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/asmitak1234/E-Krisshak-Frontend.git
   cd your-react-repo
   

2. *Install Frontend Dependencies*

   bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   

3. *Environment Variables*

   Create a .env file in the root of your project to configure environment variables.
   Include this file in the .gitignore file.


4. *Start the Development Server*

   bash
   npm start  # or yarn start
   

   The React app should be running on http://localhost:3000 and will communicate with the Django backend.

## Connection 

- *Frontend-Backend*: Frontend and Backend is connected by Axios library.

## Functionalities

- *User Interface*: A responsive and dynamic user interface built with React.
- *API Integration*: Fetches and posts data to/from the Django backend using RESTful API endpoints.
- *Form Handling*: User input and form submissions are handled with proper validation mechanisms.
- *User Authentication*: Handles user authentication (login, register) through API calls to the Django backend and gives alert to user.
- *Navigation*: Users can navigate to different web pages(Home , List , Manage) through Side Navigation Bar.
- *CRUD Operations*: Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on the main resources.

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment
This React frontend project is deployed on Vercel. Follow the steps below to deploy your frontend application:

#### Prerequisites
   - Make sure you have a Vercel account. You can sign up at Vercel.
   - Ensure your frontend code is pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

#### Steps to Deploy

   1. *Connect Your Repository*:

      - Log in to your Vercel dashboard.
      - Click on the "New Project" button.
      - Choose the Git provider where your frontend repository is hosted.
      - Authorize Vercel to access your repository.
      - Select the repository for your frontend project.

   2. *Configure Build Settings*:

      - Vercel will automatically detect the framework and settings for React. If not, you can manually specify the build settings.
      - For React, the default build command is npm run build or yarn build.
      - The output directory is typically build for React projects.

   3. *Environment Variables*:

      - Add any necessary environment variables by navigating to the "Environment Variables" section in the Vercel project settings.
      - Ensure you add variables like CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS to point to your Django backend API.

   4. *Deploy Your Project*:

      - Click on the "Deploy" button.
      -  Vercel will build and deploy your project. You can monitor the deployment progress on the Vercel dashboard.
      - Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a live URL where your frontend application is accessible.

   5. *Continuous Deployment*:

      - Whenever you push changes to the connected repository, Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy your frontend application.
      - Ensure your branch is set up correctly to trigger deployments as needed.
